# QuickStackStore

QuickStackStore is a BepInEx mod for the game Valheim that allows players to quickly stack their items in nearby chests by pressing a configurable key or UI button. This mod is based on the popular QuickStack mod by damnsneaker, and offers improved functionality and ease of use.

## Credits

- QuickStackStore is based on the [QuickStack mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/23) by damnsneaker.
- QuickStackStore is actually forked off of the [QuickerStack mod](https://github.com/klaoude/QuickerStack) by Klaoude, which fixed a few bugs QuickStack had, but I removed the threading that is special to QuickerStack.
